**Introduction**
This React wep app uses functional components and hooks (useState and useEffect) to create a note-taking app. Users can enter tasks, toggle and mark them as completed or uncompleted, and delete tasks. The user can also filter the tasks and view as either "all", "completed" or "uncompleted." The tasks are also saved to local storage on the browswer.
